## Permissions and Security

With OpenShift you can manage user rights using Role Based Access Control (RBAC).

In this exercise you will see how to grant and revoke access to users and groups in OpenShift.

[NOTE]
====
<x> and <y> will be given by the workshop supervisor
====

First, login with user<y>.

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc login -u user<y> -p openshift
----

You will receive a output similar to this because user<y> does not have access to any project:

[source,bash]
----
[user1:~] $ oc login -u user51 -p openshift
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
----

With the command below you will grant the user "user<x>" access to the project rbac-test with permissions that is included in the view role.

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc login -u user<x> -p openshift
oc adm policy add-role-to-user view user<y> -n rbac-exercise
----

You will get an output similar to this:

[source,bash]
----
[user1:~] $ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view user51 -n rbac-exercise
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/view added: "user51"
----

Now login with user<y> again and check that he has access to project rbac-exercise:

[source,bash]
----
[user1:~] $ oc login -u user51 -p openshift
Login successful.

You have one project on this server: "rbac-exercise"

Using project "rbac-exercise".
[user1:~] $
----

You can perform this same action using web console by accessing the `Administration` -> `Role Bindings` menu and clicking in the `Create Binding` button.

Now, explore the commands below that you can use to check users permissions:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm policy who-can get clusterrolebinding
oc adm policy who-can get pods -n rbac-exercise
----

Now remove the given role:

[source,bash,role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc login -u user<x> -p openshift
oc adm policy remove-role-from-user view user<y> -n rbac-exercise
----

Now run the commands below that user<y> view role has been removed from rbac-exercise project:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm policy who-can get pods -n rbac-exercise
----
